# Project Inferno
### Branching
Every change should be done on different branch other than master, in order to avoid bad merging.
So on the local repository, we create a branch (naming doesn't matter) and when we finish the change
we merge it back to the master on the cloud (Github).

### Asset naming and folder structure
To be filled with info...

### Extra Notes
* We should all have the same unity version in order to avoid the annoying errors at the start.
